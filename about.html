            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose for this website is to show viewers the various projects that I have been able to accomplish <br>
            in my programming career thus far. On top of this, the primary purpose of the website will provide basic <br>
            information as to who I am as a person so you can get a better understanding of my background and goals<br>
            in a programming career. To explain my work history I have provided a resume complete with previous jobs<br>
            I have had as well as my academic accomplishments. My goal for this website is to help future employers <br>
            get the best understanding of who I am, my accomplishments, my abilities and even just a few fun facts <br>
            about me in the fastest most efficient way possible.
