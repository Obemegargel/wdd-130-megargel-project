                <h2>Science</h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy science. In high school <br>
                    even though chemestry was hard for me <br>
                    it was one of my favorite classes. <br>
                    Biology was easier and very interesting.
                </p>
                <h2>Math</h2>
                <p>
                    I struggled with math in elementry <br>
                    school, but then my fifth grade <br>
                    teacher helped me gain confidence <br>
                    and I have loved math ever since.
                </p>
                <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>
                    I really enjoy reading books. <br>
                    Science fiction and fantacy are<br>
                    my favorites. It is even a goal <br>
                    of mine to write a book one day.

                <h2>Moral Compass</h2>
                <p>
                    I always want to do what is right. <br>
                    I firmly believe in being honest <br>
                    and working hard and helping others.
                </p>
                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>
                    Family comes first always. I think <br>
                    that mentality helps me stay focused <br>
                    on what is important while at work and <br>
                    while at home.
                </p>
                <h2>Improvement</h2>
                <p>
                    I really like learning. The feeling I <br>
                    get from working on a new skill is <br>
                    exciting to me. I like working on my<br>
                    skills and improving always.
